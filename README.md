# Sqm2Json

This gem can convert SQM mission files from Arma3 to JSON documents. And vice versa. Missions content can be either parsed easily, and generated from standard JSON representation.  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sqm2json'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sqm2json

## Usage

This library embeds a single module called **Sqm2Json**: include or extends it, then you can play with it:




## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
